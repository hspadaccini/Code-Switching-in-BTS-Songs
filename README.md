# Code-Switching-in-BTS-Songs

This project was done as a part of a larger research project that aimed to analyze the use of English-language code-switching in K-pop more broadly by looking at the lyrics of K-pop super group BTS' most popular songs from their debut in 2013 to April 2020. Solo songs and songs without music videos were excluded from the data for a better representation of the band's music all together. Furthermore, a song with a music video has extra money dedicated to that song and indicates that the production company has some faith in the song as a potential hit. YouTube views and Spotify hits were used to determine the popularity of these songs. There was a qualitative analysis of the use of code-switching in South Korean media and the economic-political interaction of the K-pop industry in South Korea that preceeded the Python analysis. 

The data set was annotated for whichever member of the 7-person group sang a given English-language lyric to determine if the members who are fluent in English used it more often than members who did not have a high level of English. The frequency and percentage of English lyrics per band member, per year, and overall were calculated and visualized using a heat-map computation matrix. This was a first attempt at a computational linguistics project that was completely performed by myself without assistance from teachers or other students.
